Someone at parenting media Co. please explain to me how my 2 very young children need to see an ad for a visa that has a drag queen peddling this nonsense. If I didn't know any better I'd say it feels like your grooming. Shame on you guys for allowing this rubbish. ""Safe streaming"" and ""safe ads"".
